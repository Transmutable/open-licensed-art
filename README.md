# Open Licensed Art

In this repo you'll find art assets that have been released under some sort of open license and collected by folks at [Transmutable](https://transmutable.com/), an XR studio in Seattle.

Be certain to look at the LICENSE.md file in the directory with the assets as there are a lot of different open licenses with different restrictions!
